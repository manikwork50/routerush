    <h1 class="dest-title">Taj Mahal — Agra, Uttar Pradesh</h1>

    <div class="section-header">History</div>
    <p class="section-text">
      Commissioned by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1632 and substantially completed by 1648 (with finishing works continuing into the 1650s),
      the Taj Mahal is a mausoleum built for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. It stands on the right bank of the Yamuna River in Agra,
      the then Mughal capital. The design fuses Persian, Timurid, and Indo-Islamic elements into a perfect, symmetrical composition: a white marble tomb
      raised on a square plinth, framed by four minarets, preceded by a grand gate (darwaza-i rauza), and set within a charbagh (four-quartered) garden aligned on a central axis.
      Calligraphy inlaid with black marble, pietra dura floral panels using semi-precious stones (jasper, jade, lapis, carnelian), and exquisitely carved jali screens
      create an effect of weightless intricacy. Over centuries, the Taj has survived political change, colonial curiosity, and environmental challenges, yet retains its emotional pull:
      a monument to memory, grief, and imperial craftsmanship at its pinnacle.
    </p>

    <div class="section-header">Why It’s Famous</div>
    <p class="section-text">
      Beyond its love-story aura, the Taj is renowned as perhaps the most perfectly proportioned building in the world.
      The way its white Makrana marble changes tone through the day—rosy at dawn, luminous at noon, golden at sunset—adds drama to the symmetry.
      It’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site and among the “Seven Wonders” in popular lists, drawing millions of visitors annually.
      For many travelers, the first glimpse through the gate—where the tomb appears framed like a living painting—is unforgettable.

  <div class="section-header">History</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    The Golden Temple, also known as Harmandir Sahib or Darbar Sahib, is the holiest shrine in Sikhism.
    It was founded by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577, and the construction was completed by his successor Guru Arjan Dev in 1604.
    The temple was rebuilt and covered with gold foil in the early 19th century by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, which gave it its iconic golden appearance.
    The temple complex has survived invasions and attacks throughout history and remains a symbol of Sikh spirituality, peace, and resilience.

  <div class="section-header">Why It’s Famous</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    Renowned for its magnificent golden façade and the serene Amrit Sarovar (holy pool) that surrounds it,
    the Golden Temple attracts millions of visitors and pilgrims annually.

  <div class="section-header">History</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    India Gate is a war memorial located in the heart of New Delhi, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens.
    Completed in 1931, it commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Indian Army during World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War.
    The structure is inspired by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and stands as an imposing archway on Rajpath, forming a significant part of Delhi's ceremonial corridor.
  </p>

  <div class="section-header">Why It’s Famous</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    India Gate is a popular spot for locals and tourists alike, offering a mix of history and leisure.
    The monument is illuminated beautifully at night, and its expansive lawns are a favored picnic spot.
    The Amar Jawan Jyoti, or the Flame of the Immortal Soldier, was added later to honor soldiers who died in 1971 Indo-Pakistan war.

  <h1 class="dest-title">Hawa Mahal — Jaipur, Rajasthan</h1>

  <div class="section-header">History</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    The Hawa Mahal or "Palace of Winds" was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, designed by Lal Chand Ustad.
    It was constructed as an extension of the City Palace to allow royal ladies to observe street festivals unseen by the public, adhering to the purdah tradition.
    The five-storey pink sandstone structure is a striking example of Rajput architecture influenced by Mughal style, featuring 953 small windows ("jharokhas") with intricate latticework.
  </p>

  <div class="section-header">Why It’s Famous</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    The Mahal is famous for its unique honeycomb façade and sheer architectural beauty.

  <div class="section-header">History</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    Varanasi, also known as Kashi or Banaras, is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, with history dating back over 3000 years.
    The ghats are riverfront steps leading down to the banks of the Ganges River, constructed over centuries by various rulers and devotees.
    Varanasi has been a cultural and spiritual center, especially in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The ghats host rituals, ceremonies, and festivals, continuing ancient traditions.

  <h1 class="dest-title">Varanasi Ghats (Dashashwamedh–Manikarnika belt) — Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh</h1>

  <div class="section-header">History</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    Varanasi (Kashi/Benares) is amongst the world’s oldest living cities. Myth credits Lord Shiva with founding it; historical references stretch back over two millennia. Its riverfront ghats—stone steps descending to the Ganges—were extensively rebuilt by Maratha rulers in the 18th–19th centuries, bundling palaces, temples, and dharamshalas into a continuous architectural theater. Dashashwamedh Ghat hosts elaborate evening aarti ceremonies, while Manikarnika and Harishchandra Ghats are principal cremation grounds central to Hindu beliefs about life, death, and moksha (liberation). The city’s labyrinthine lanes shelter shrines, akharas, silk weavers, and classical music traditions.
  </p>

  <div class="section-header">Why It’s Famous</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    Varanasi distills India’s spiritual intensity: sunrise boat rides with saffron-clad priests, chanting students, and pilgrims bathing; the hypnotic aarti’s lamps mirrored in the river at dusk; and the frank proximity to mortality at the cremation ghats. It’s also famed for Banarasi silk sarees, paan, thandai, and a fiercely alive street culture. Walking from Assi to Manikarnika, absorbing scents of incense and marigold, temple bells, and flute strains, is a profound experience.

  <h1 class="dest-title">Hampi (Vijayanagara Ruins) — Ballari District, Karnataka</h1>

  <div class="section-header">History</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    Hampi was the glittering capital of the Vijayanagara Empire (14th–16th centuries), once one of the world’s largest cities. Travelers like Niccolò de’ Conti and Domingo Paes wrote of bustling bazaars, grand processional avenues, and sophisticated water-management systems. In 1565, after the Battle of Talikota, the city was sacked, leaving a surreal landscape of granite boulders and hundreds of monuments: the Virupaksha Temple (still active), Vittala Temple with its famed stone chariot and musical pillars, royal enclosures with the Mahanavami Dibba and stepped tank, and the Lotus Mahal and Elephant Stables in the Zenana enclosure. The Tungabhadra River threads the site, and Anjanadri Hill across the river is associated with Hanuman lore.
  </p>

  <div class="section-header">Why It’s Famous</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    Few places match Hampi’s combination of archaeological scale and natural drama. You can clamber up Matanga Hill for sunrise, cycle through temple avenues, and watch langurs pose among colonnades. The craftsmanship—intricate bas-reliefs of dancers, deities, and processions; corbelled mantapas; and still-functioning water channels—makes the ruins feel surprisingly alive.

  <h1 class="dest-title">Konark Sun Temple — Konark, Odisha</h1>

  <div class="section-header">History</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    Built in the 13th century under Eastern Ganga king Narasimhadeva I (circa 1250 CE), the Konark Sun Temple is conceived as a colossal stone chariot for Surya, the Sun god, drawn by seven horses and set upon twenty-four intricately carved wheels. Much of the sanctum’s upper structure has collapsed over time, but the jagamohana (assembly hall) and surviving sculptures remain among India’s finest temple carvings: celestial musicians, dancers frozen mid-gesture, mythical beasts, and narrative friezes that reveal courtly life, maritime trade, erotica, and devotional scenes. Konark, along with Puri Jagannath and Bhubaneswar’s Lingaraja, forms Odisha’s sacred triangle and exemplifies Kalinga temple architecture—curvilinear shikharas, ornate doorjambs, and precise iconographic programs.
  </p>

  <div class="section-header">Why It’s Famous</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    The sheer scale and ambition of turning a temple into a moving cosmic diagram is breathtaking. The stone wheels double as sundials, and the horses seem to surge forward from the platform. Konark’s carvings are both technically superb and humanly tender, making it a dream for historians, photographers, and anyone interested in the evolution of Indian temple art. The annual Konark Dance Festival celebrates classical forms against this dramatic backdrop.

  <div class="section-header">History</div>
  <p class="section-text">
    Founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, Jaipur was India’s first planned city, designed according to Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra principles.
    The City Palace remains the ceremonial heart, blending Rajput, Mughal, and European styles. It includes courtyards and grand gateways like the Peacock Gate, Mubarak Mahal museum, and Chandra Mahal royal residence.
    Nearby, Amber (Amer) Fort predates Jaipur—built by Raja Man Singh I in the late 16th century and expanded by successive Kachwaha rulers.
    Its sandstone and marble palaces, including Sheesh Mahal and Diwan-i-Khas, overlook Maota Lake. Amber’s strategic hilltop location made it the Kachwahas’ seat before Jaipur’s founding.
